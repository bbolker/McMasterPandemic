\title{generate a contact matrix (where each row is a probability distribution)}
\usage{
mk_pmat(age_cat = mk_agecats(), dist = "unif")
}
\arguments{
\item{age_cat}{age categories (made with `mk_agecats()`)}

\item{dist}{(character) either "unif" for uniform, "rand" for a random distributions by age, or "diag" for strictly within-age mixing (pmat = the identity matrix)}
}
