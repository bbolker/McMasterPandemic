# On Math ans Weighting

## Model and Definitions
- Assume there are 3 groups of individuals: $S$, $I$ and $R$.
- Each group splits into 4 subgroups to incorporate the testing mechanism, so overall the model framework has 12 compartments:
$S_u, S_n, S_p, S_t, I_u, I_n, I_p, I_t, R_u, R_n, R_p, R_t$.

## Per Capita Rate of Flow from Untested to Positive or Negative Compartments
Let look at the flow form a particular untested compartment, $Z_i$ to a particular tested awaiting for a negative test. The equation is $$\frac{d Z_i}{dt} = - f_i Z_i,$$
 where $f_i$, is the per capita rate of flow, with the dimension of $\frac{1/time}{\#}$, where by # I mean population number.
 
1. How to define $f_i$ as a function of *testing intensity*, $t$ and *weights*, $\omega_i$.
Checkings:
- $t$ is fixed and is a parameter of the model, it is given through the reported information, dimension of $t$ is $\#/time$.
- dimension of $\omega_i$ is $1/\#$. Possible definition of $\omega_i$:
(i) $\frac{\omega_i}{\sum_j \omega_j} \times \frac{Z_i/I_u}{\sum_j Z_j}$, where $I_u$ is untested people in compartment $I$.
