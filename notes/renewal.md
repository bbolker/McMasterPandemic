title: "renewal processes/latent states/etc."

What can we do to revive some of the methods we think are useful but aren't currently using?

* **latent states**: currently doing trajectory-matching
    * reimplement core simulation in TMB or Stan or ... ???
* **renewal processes**
    * what's the simplest EpiEstim-like machine we can build? Would this be equivalent to deconvolution?
