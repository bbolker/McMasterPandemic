## Getting data

```{r get_data, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
L1 <- load("ontario_clean.RData")
L2 <- load("ontario_calibration.RData")  ## g1=calib to all, g2=hospital only
L3 <- load("epiestim.RData")
## FIXME: better documentation about what these pieces are doing?
## move the keep_vars/ont_recent_sub stuff to ontario_clean.R ?
```

Reading data from Michael Li's [curated Canadian COVID data repository](https://wzmli.github.io/COVID19-Canada)
harvested from official sources such as [this](https://www.ontario.ca/page/2019-novel-coronavirus#section-0). (Latest data in this example are from `r format(max(ont_recent_sub$date))`.)

## Basic visualization

These are simply plots of the data with quadratic (log-)linear model fits to each time series (this is not the optimal statistical approach, which would account for the fact that the data are counts, but is easy and is fine for visualization purposes).

```{r ONplot,message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
print(gg1 <- ggplot(ont_all_nt, aes(date,value,colour=var))
  + geom_point()
  + scale_y_log10()
  + geom_smooth(method="lm",formula=y~poly(x,2))
)
```

**FIXME**: could make prettier (direct labels), add `newTests/1000`, etc. (how much effort do we want to put in here?)

Some conclusions

- Natural for ICU and Ventilator to be parallel (no real lags here)
- Weird that the ICU/vent curves are flattening/decling before the other series: not apparently a capacity issue, maybe something about reporting (e.g. see [here](https://www.ontario.ca/page/2019-novel-coronavirus#7))?

Picture is cleaner (and flattening is more apparent) if we focus on more recent data.

```{r plot_recent, warning=FALSE}
print(gg1 %+% ont_recent_nt)
```

We want to find the first _useful/meaningful_ day for each variable and adjust the different time series to their respective meaningful day.

```{r ont_plot_shift, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
print(gg2 <- ggplot(ont_recent_nt,aes(vday,value,colour=var))
    + geom_point()
    + scale_y_log10()
    + geom_smooth(method="lm",formula=y~poly(x,2))
    + scale_x_continuous(limits=c(-1,NA))
)
```

## Fitting to data

We don't use this for calibration any more, but it is of some interest to fit log-quadratic curves to the data (this closely parallels the well-known IHME model ...). Use raw polynomials to parameterize in terms of initial slope rather than average slope.

- intercepts for variables other than newConfirmations describe sensitivity (how small a non-zero value is actually reported?
- slopes are similar (newConfirmations maybe a little slower?)
- don't know why ICU (and slightly less) hospitalization are flattening faster. Can't really be explained by (constant) underreporting or reaching capacity (we're not); there were some changes in ICU reporting that may have lower double-counting, but ???

## time-series calibration

We don't do this any more, but one calibration strategy is to use a phenomenological fit to the initial stage of the epidemic to estimate the initial growth rate ($r_0$).

We have a variety of time series (case reports, hospitalization, ICU, ventilator, death) from which to try to estimate initial growth rate $r_0$ (and potentially any time variation in $r$, which we would usually attribute to behavioural change or physical distancing efforts); we could pick any one of these, or some average.

* in general it is better to fit to incidence-like variables rather than cumulative values or prevalence (e.g. hospital/ICU/ventilation utilization), because cumulative and prevalence values are considerably autocorrelated. We can always make a cumulative variable into an incidence-like variable by differencing it, although in the case of health utilization (hospital, ICU, vent), this will include changes due to both admission and discharge; we would prefer a hospital admission time series if it were available. In general cumulative curves will still give reasonable estimates of the initial growth rate, but they will underestimate uncertainty [REF Rohani and King?]
* case confirmations are difficult to interpret because they are strongly confounded with time-varying testing intensity and criteria.
* when possible, especially when estimating *changes* in $r$ we would prefer to use leading rather than lagging indicators (cases > hospital admissions > hospital occupancy > death)
* in general more severe outcomes are less likely to be underreported or inconsistently reported (deaths > hospitalizations > infections)
* given that health utilization is not too high (saturating/overwhelming resources) ICU, vent, and hospital occupancy are relatively equivalent, given that a reasonably constant fraction of hospitalized cases require ICU/ventilators. (ICU occupancy will probably lag acute-care a bit because the average occupancy time is longer, although there is also a post-ICU acute-care period.)
* we chose to calibrate to hospitalizations, although as shown above there is not a big difference between the estimated $r$ based on new confirmations vs. hospital occupancy. 

This earlier version of calibration

* take a multivariate Normal sample of the intercept and initial slope from the log-quadratic fit; append a Normal sample from a prior for the generation interval (we used mean=6, sd=0.2 [probably too narrow])? For each sample we 

1. calibrated the parameters to $\bar G$ (adjusting latent period and infectious period for asymptomatic, mild, severe cases [not pre-symptomatic period])
2. calibrated the initial growth rate $r(0)$ to the slope (adjusting baseline transmission `beta0`)3. calibrate the starting value by picking $E(0)$ values until, starting from an earlier time with $S=N-E(0)$, $E=E(0)$ and all other states 0, we hit the intercept 
4. run the simulation forward.

Notes: (a) the first two steps are independent; (b) we could also calibrate the shape of the generation interval; (c) this calibration procedure doesn't account for later changes, and relies on estimates in the exponential phase; (d) it would be nice to replace step 3 with an analytical calculation based on the dominant eigenvector, but a combination of Jacobian issues and sensitivity to time steps etc. has made this hard so far.

## combined calibration

What if we want to estimate `beta0`, `E0`, and more than one breakpoint at the same time? 

Break points

The fit takes `r round(t_ont_cal1[["elapsed"]])` seconds.

Initially tried to fit `c_prop` (proportion of cases reported) and `phi2` (proportion of ICU dying) but got ridiculous answers and non-pos-def Hessians: real non-identifiability or just wonky data? Or some outcome of some of the other shortcuts/problems in the fitting (e.g. equal dispersion parameters per variable)?

Estimated parameters:

```{r pars}
coef(ont_cal1,"fitted")
```

There are strong positive correlations (0.9 - 0.97) among the breakpoint effects, and strong negative correlations (-0.97 - -0.99) between the breakpoint effects and the initial growth rate - this is presumably saying that the initial growth rate is very uncertain while the growth rates after the breakpoints (which are $\exp(\beta_0 + \Delta \beta_i)$) are relatively certain ...

```{r corrs, eval=FALSE}
vv <- solve(ont_cal1$hessian)
corrplot::corrplot.mixed(cov2cor(vv),lower="number",upper="ellipse")
```

What are the implied R0 values here?

```{r R0_summary}
ss <- summary(ont_cal1)
knitr::kable(data.frame(date=ss$start_date,round(ss[,-1],3)))
```

```{r out_params}
## assemble table of fitted+assumed parameters
f_args <- ont_cal1$forecast_args
i1 <- coef(ont_cal1,"fitted")
params_fitted <- coef(ont_cal1)
## hack to get names of params used to adjust Gbar
moment_params <- eval(formals(fix_pars)$pars_adj)[[2]]
out <- (describe_params(params_fitted)
    %>% mutate(type=case_when(
                   symbol %in% names(i1$params) ~ "mle-calibrated",
                   symbol %in% moment_params ~ "Gbar-calibrated",
                   TRUE ~ "assumed"),
               type=factor(type,levels=c("mle-calibrated",
                                         "Gbar-calibrated",
                                         "assumed")))
    %>% arrange(type)
)
```

Now forecast using the fitted parameters.

* confidence intervals not for public consumption (since they include only a subset of parametric uncertainty)
* As expected, since R0>1 at the end of our time series, the epidemic just keeps going ...

**fixme**: restore legend, make sure that we're not fitting silly parameters (should be fixed to sensible values)
