A place to keep notes on vaxify implementation assumptions and future work (instead of dumping everything into FIXMEs).

## Assumptions

* Everyone starts in the unvaccinated compartment, regardless of epi status or point in the epidemic.

## To fix

## Questions (for Ben)

1. I have a choice between handling the calculation of per capita daily vaccination rates as a pre-processing step or in the sim... does it matter for `timepars` or `calibrate` when these rates are calculated?

* set up fully expanded state vec
* use given state vec `x`, or don't
* allocate `E0`:
  * use eigenvector, or don't 
* update S classes
  * deal with testify separately
